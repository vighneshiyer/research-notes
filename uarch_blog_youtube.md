# Microarchitecture Analysis Media

My instinct is that there is a significant audience of people (people who work in semiconductors, laypeople interested in technology, uarch researchers) who are looking for highly recent microarchitecture analysis of commercial silicon (all kinds of chips intended for datacenter, desktop, mobile, embedded, and devboards).

## The Product

I would expect coverage of these kinds of chips:

I would expect coverage of these venues and relevant technology projections:

I would expect these kinds of analyses
Why isn't anyone doing a good job of this?

## Existing Players

Systematic comparison of commercial silicon running similar benchmarks (both for desktop e.g. Phoronix and datacenter e.g. stuff we will figure out)

## Opportunities
