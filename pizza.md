# Pizza

- This is indeed a research topic

## Admin Tasks

- [x] Plan next trial (cooridinate with Jerry and Daniel) [d:10/4]
- [ ] Oven equity from Joonho and Daniel [d:12/10]

## Note from the first oven firing and pizza trial on 10/1/2023

> Postmortem:
>
> - Main issue: oven got too cold too fast, I think its a combo of closing the baffle too much (since the oven started at 1000+F) and having too many pellets pushed in too early - need to go a lot more slowly and never fill the pellet jar more than halfway otherwise the gravity force is too high
>     - if the oven is hot enough, then we can indeed crank out 1 pizza every 60-90 seconds
>     - but with this cold oven, we could only manage 1 pizza every 2-10 minutes (as things got worse throughout the night)
> - pizzas can't be too thin - the crust needs to be thicker and can't have too many toppings or else the crust doesn't cook through and puff
>     - need longer proofing time too
> - need a turning peel - can't use my small flat stick since the handle is too short and the base is too small - keeping the oven open too long loses heat
> - need a brush - the stone gets stuff on it after every pizza and we need to sweep it away
> - need a better assembly line - dedicated people doing specific tasks
>     - need multiple cutting boards to parallelize ingredient prep (cheese and produce), meats don't need cutting boards
>     - need multiple knives to make this work too
>     - a cutting wheel for pizza would be nice too
>     - need more prep plates to keep prepped items
> - pizzas were too small - we divided each TJs doughball 4 ways, 2 ways should be better, we had plenty of space in the oven
> - pizzas need to be personal - everyone chooses toppings for themselves and then the pizza is passed down the pipeline
> - the oven cooldown time is significant - we should only let the oven be on for ~1 hour, then begin cooldown immediately
>     - ideally start the cooking at 5pm and everyone is fed by 630p and then oven is cold by 8p
>     - we started the oven around 7p, fed everyone around 830p, and cold oven will take until 10p - too late

    - Let the pellets burn for 10-15 minutes before adding new ones
    - After then, add pellets in small quantities every 3 minutes (don't fill to the top)
    - Tap the hopper every time pellets are added to make sure they aren't stuck and fall down
    - Build up to a large quantity of pellets in the hopper slowly, it should take 20+ minutes before the hopper is filled
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HBCGQF9720
    - Use a skinny metal file to push pellets through the hopper to make sure there are no jams
    - Use a USB fan to blow air from the back to provide good intake oxygen
    - Don't tap on the hopper since it can close the baffle, add more resistance to the baffle with another nut
    - Blow ashes out of the way to make sure air intake is clear

- [x] Specify roles [d:10/11]

Roles:

@jz you are in charge of chilling beers and alcohol/cups transportation. put beers in fridge on Friday morning, take them to Cory in Arya's cooler with ice from the slice freezer. take more non-alcoholic drinks in bags (i will provide bags on Friday)

@Joonho Whangbo you are in charge of the dough. you will proof the doughballs in Soda at room temp for 4 hours prior to the event (i will bring the doughballs defrosted and refridgerated Friday morning). you will stretch the dough balls into 12" pizzas. technique is critical - watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Entzcl8q7H4 (also bring your crate from home)

@Raghav Gupta you are in charge of ingredient prep and stocking. i have 3 cutting boards and 2 knives you can use (others will help you in the early stages). you will wash and chop vegetables, slice cheese, and keep the ingredient pipeline organized and stocked (including sauce). vegetables must be cut in the right way. you will also help with slicing pizzas from the oven and distributing slices.

@dpgrubb you are in charge of pizza preparation. take orders from people and apply the sauce, cheese, toppings, and finishings. technique here is also critical - excessive or misplaced toppings or cheese will give a bad result. (also bring your cast iron heat extractor)

@vighnesh.iyer I am in charge of the oven. Fire and temperature management, sweeping, loading/turning/retrieving pizzas.

We are all in charge of transporting things to Cory from Soda. We will leave Soda at 5pm and begin setup. The goal is to have pizzas out by 6pm and the oven off by 730pm.

Pipeline:

Our goal is to make personal (1-2 person) pizzas.
Each 12" pizza can feed 2 people.
For reference, the small pizzas at Jupiter are 9" and the large ones are 13".

- @Joonho Whangbo will initiate the process. Pick 2 people to come and select their toppings + stretch their dough on the floured/cornmeal'ed wood peel.
- @dpgrubb will apply the toppings. During this time, joonho can begin stretching the next doughball on the pizza pan while the peel is in use.
- Once the pizza is ready on the wood peel, I will place it into the oven and return the peel to the start of the line.
- We will be backend bound (hopefully). 1.5 minutes per pizza and another 1.5 minutes to get the stone hot again for the next one. Total time for ~20 pizzas should be under 1.5 hours.
- I will draw a pipeline diagram in a bit

- [x] Purchase groceries [d:10/12]

We bought:

- Cheeses
    - 4x shredded low-moisture mozz bags
    - 8x fresh mozz balls
    - 1 box each of burrata and part-skim ricotta
    - 1 wedge of DOP parm
- Toppings
    - Campari tomatoes 5x boxes
    - 3x red onions
    - 5x 2x garlic packs
    - 4x green bell peppers
    - 2x basil plants
    - 2x jars of kalamata olives
- Meats
    - 2x pepperoni packs
    - 1x salami pack
    - 1x prosciutto pack
- Sauce
    - 4x TJ pizza sauce (we already have 1 jar of Rao's marinara in lab too)
- Spices
    - Sea salt grinder (we already have pepper grinder in lab)
    - Flour (for dusting dough balls in fridge)
- Alcohol
    - 1x bottle port (I think we have enough other stuff in lab)
- Total: $154.44

- [x] Put away kitchen items and doughballs for bringing to Soda [d:10/12]
- [x] Solicit donations [d:10/15]

### Retrospective

- baffle in chimney is a big problem - too much smoke and no clean burn
    - couldn't tension it in the right way
    - perhaps it is better to just remove the baffle altogether
- wasn't able to get enough pellets in the hopper for sustained burn, had to keep adding few pellets at a time on the base fire rather than the base fire being strong enough to ignite all the gravity fed pellets
    - this was suboptimal since temperature kept fluctuating and sometimes I ran out of pellets and the fire would smoulder until I turned the air intake up again
    - much better if we could just gravity feed pellets and only refeed every 10 minutes rather than racing to refeed every 1-2 minutes
- cleaning the pizza stone and minimizing flour is essential
    - the current approach of metal brush doesn't work as the metal brush is eaten by the heat! - it also is not that effective at removing burned stuff
    - need an alternative sweep
    - this seems better: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MKMJ7FY
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/uuni/comments/kjqfqm/best_brush_to_remove_ash_between_pizzas_for_ooni/
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/uuni/comments/n9y1xw/metal_brush_for_cleaning_stone_between_pizzas/
- need to move the fire to the front + get enough pellets in very quickly before firing pizzas to keep heat consistent
    - gravity fed pellets should be used rather than keeping fire burning with only a few at a time, even though that gave us nice hot temps
    - need to use the thermometer
- need to actually use thermometer more often and understand what the ideal temp should look like both in the center of the stone and in the back
- need to optimize the pipeline itself
    - people again had too many jobs
    - dough stretching must be done according to technique without roller pin which squishes out air and makes the dough denser and longer to cook
    - no one should have to hold the chimney baffle in place
    - we should actually make personal pizzas - 10 inch pizzas (not 12), adjust recipe, we will need a lot less flour and we can pack things in the proofing tray easier
- proofing tray should be used instead of tupperware for sure - its too much work to clean tupperware
- we should prep all vegetables and cheese and sauce ahead of time in the slice kitchen, only doing stuff in the cory courtyard if needed lazily
    - we need to use a lot less ingredients here, less is more
    - we bought too many tomatoes, bell peppers, and onions
    - we need a bit more variety + slice basil ahead of time
    - prepping garlic is very time consuming without the right equipment - using pre-sliced garlic might be worth it here
- we should not use cornmeal, only flour
- we should only have 2 pizza variants and just force people to choose one
    - greatly minimize the number of unique toppings
- switch to 10" personal pizzas + ask Ooni for dough recipe modification
- get more disposable stuff from Costco (plates, bowls)

## Dealing with Ooni Chimney Baffle

> Order: US963992
> Serial: P0AD00-30-MNZ5Q

> Hi,
>
> I'm having a great time with my Fyra 12! But there is one major issue. The chimney baffle isn't staying in the open position - the control seems very loose and trying to tighten the nut doesn't help. As a result, the baffle often gets closed during operation (without us manipulating the baffle control) and the fire gets stuffed and smoke builds in the oven (and the hopper is also covered with sticky soot that I can't clean). I've had to resort to having someone with fireproof gloves managing the baffle carefully during oven operation. I'm using the Ooni wood pellets and firestarter and carefully managing the fire as far I can tell. I'm also using a small fan to push air into the oven from the back to make sure there is sufficient oxygen for the fire.
>
> Secondly, I noticed a small chip on the pizza stone (pictures attached). I'm not sure if it was damaged during shipping since I don't think I've moved the pizza stone since I received it.
>
> Could you ship me a replacement chimney (with baffle) and hopper? It would be nice to get a replacement pizza stone too, but I understand if you believe it was not damaged during shipping.
>
> Thanks so much for your help!

> Thanks,
> Vighnesh
