# Pizza

- This is indeed a research topic

## Admin Tasks

- [x] Plan next trial (cooridinate with Jerry and Daniel) [d:10/4]
- [ ] Oven equity from Joonho and Daniel
    - Defer this until the next pizza party - but actually enough time has passed where I can just retain ownership and sell it to Joonho after I graduate - that seems easier than each of us selling our ownership slice over time

## Note from the first oven firing and pizza trial on 10/1/2023

> Postmortem:
>
> - Main issue: oven got too cold too fast, I think its a combo of closing the baffle too much (since the oven started at 1000+F) and having too many pellets pushed in too early - need to go a lot more slowly and never fill the pellet jar more than halfway otherwise the gravity force is too high
>     - if the oven is hot enough, then we can indeed crank out 1 pizza every 60-90 seconds
>     - but with this cold oven, we could only manage 1 pizza every 2-10 minutes (as things got worse throughout the night)
> - pizzas can't be too thin - the crust needs to be thicker and can't have too many toppings or else the crust doesn't cook through and puff
>     - need longer proofing time too
> - need a turning peel - can't use my small flat stick since the handle is too short and the base is too small - keeping the oven open too long loses heat
> - need a brush - the stone gets stuff on it after every pizza and we need to sweep it away
> - need a better assembly line - dedicated people doing specific tasks
>     - need multiple cutting boards to parallelize ingredient prep (cheese and produce), meats don't need cutting boards
>     - need multiple knives to make this work too
>     - a cutting wheel for pizza would be nice too
>     - need more prep plates to keep prepped items
> - pizzas were too small - we divided each TJs doughball 4 ways, 2 ways should be better, we had plenty of space in the oven
> - pizzas need to be personal - everyone chooses toppings for themselves and then the pizza is passed down the pipeline
> - the oven cooldown time is significant - we should only let the oven be on for ~1 hour, then begin cooldown immediately
>     - ideally start the cooking at 5pm and everyone is fed by 630p and then oven is cold by 8p
>     - we started the oven around 7p, fed everyone around 830p, and cold oven will take until 10p - too late

    - Let the pellets burn for 10-15 minutes before adding new ones
    - After then, add pellets in small quantities every 3 minutes (don't fill to the top)
    - Tap the hopper every time pellets are added to make sure they aren't stuck and fall down
    - Build up to a large quantity of pellets in the hopper slowly, it should take 20+ minutes before the hopper is filled
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HBCGQF9720
    - Use a skinny metal file to push pellets through the hopper to make sure there are no jams
    - Use a USB fan to blow air from the back to provide good intake oxygen
    - Don't tap on the hopper since it can close the baffle, add more resistance to the baffle with another nut
    - Blow ashes out of the way to make sure air intake is clear

- Things I bought from TJs: bell peppers, tomatoes, whole mozz (buffalo preferred), shredded mozz, pizza sauce, pizza dough, fresh basil plant
    - People coming: me, joonho, lux, coleman, raghav, josh, jerry
- Things I had to bring from home:
    - Food: pizza sauce, pizza dough, fresh mozz, shredded mozz, parm, onion, bell peppers, garlic, olives, tomatoes, olive oil, salt/pepper, basil plant, dried oregano/basil/crushed red pepper
    - Equipment: knife, cutting board, dough slicer, cling wrap, towels, aluminum foil, turning peel, microplane, mitts, spoons/ladles, scissors, trash bags, coarse salt, fire extinguisher
- Things we brought from lab: napkins, paper plates + bowls, knives, forks
- Things we needed: bottle opener, large plate for slicing pizzas (there are a few in Cory lounge we can use), pizza slicer

- Things I will still bring
    - Knife (for vegetarian cutting), dough slicer, towels, microplane, mitts, spoons/ladles, scissors, trash bag, extinguisher, olive oil dispenser, dried herbs (oregano + basil + red pepper flakes), bags for transport and refrigeration, knife sharpener, metal poker for hopper
    - ruler, immersion blender, san marzano can (for ez fresh sauce)

    - ??? - this is not my expertise, the selection shouldn't require any preparation
- Alcohol
    - few white wines
    - few more bottles of port
    - can we find mead? haha :)

- [x] Specify roles [d:10/11]

Roles:

@jz you are in charge of chilling beers and alcohol/cups transportation. put beers in fridge on Friday morning, take them to Cory in Arya's cooler with ice from the slice freezer. take more non-alcoholic drinks in bags (i will provide bags on Friday)

@Joonho Whangbo you are in charge of the dough. you will proof the doughballs in Soda at room temp for 4 hours prior to the event (i will bring the doughballs defrosted and refridgerated Friday morning). you will stretch the dough balls into 12" pizzas. technique is critical - watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Entzcl8q7H4 (also bring your crate from home)

@Raghav Gupta you are in charge of ingredient prep and stocking. i have 3 cutting boards and 2 knives you can use (others will help you in the early stages). you will wash and chop vegetables, slice cheese, and keep the ingredient pipeline organized and stocked (including sauce). vegetables must be cut in the right way. you will also help with slicing pizzas from the oven and distributing slices.

@dpgrubb you are in charge of pizza preparation. take orders from people and apply the sauce, cheese, toppings, and finishings. technique here is also critical - excessive or misplaced toppings or cheese will give a bad result. (also bring your cast iron heat extractor)

@vighnesh.iyer I am in charge of the oven. Fire and temperature management, sweeping, loading/turning/retrieving pizzas.

We are all in charge of transporting things to Cory from Soda. We will leave Soda at 5pm and begin setup. The goal is to have pizzas out by 6pm and the oven off by 730pm.

Pipeline:

Our goal is to make personal (1-2 person) pizzas.
Each 12" pizza can feed 2 people.
For reference, the small pizzas at Jupiter are 9" and the large ones are 13".

- @Joonho Whangbo will initiate the process. Pick 2 people to come and select their toppings + stretch their dough on the floured/cornmeal'ed wood peel.
- @dpgrubb will apply the toppings. During this time, joonho can begin stretching the next doughball on the pizza pan while the peel is in use.
- Once the pizza is ready on the wood peel, I will place it into the oven and return the peel to the start of the line.
- We will be backend bound (hopefully). 1.5 minutes per pizza and another 1.5 minutes to get the stone hot again for the next one. Total time for ~20 pizzas should be under 1.5 hours.
- I will draw a pipeline diagram in a bit

- [x] Purchase groceries [d:10/12]

We bought:

- Cheeses
    - 4x shredded low-moisture mozz bags
    - 8x fresh mozz balls
    - 1 box each of burrata and part-skim ricotta
    - 1 wedge of DOP parm
- Toppings
    - Campari tomatoes 5x boxes
    - 3x red onions
    - 5x 2x garlic packs
    - 4x green bell peppers
    - 2x basil plants
    - 2x jars of kalamata olives
- Meats
    - 2x pepperoni packs
    - 1x salami pack
    - 1x prosciutto pack
- Sauce
    - 4x TJ pizza sauce (we already have 1 jar of Rao's marinara in lab too)
- Spices
    - Sea salt grinder (we already have pepper grinder in lab)
    - Flour (for dusting dough balls in fridge)
- Alcohol
    - 1x bottle port (I think we have enough other stuff in lab)
- Total: $154.44

- [x] Put away kitchen items and doughballs for bringing to Soda [d:10/12]
- [x] Solicit donations [d:10/15]

### Retrospective

- baffle in chimney is a big problem - too much smoke and no clean burn
    - couldn't tension it in the right way
    - perhaps it is better to just remove the baffle altogether
- wasn't able to get enough pellets in the hopper for sustained burn, had to keep adding few pellets at a time on the base fire rather than the base fire being strong enough to ignite all the gravity fed pellets
    - this was suboptimal since temperature kept fluctuating and sometimes I ran out of pellets and the fire would smoulder until I turned the air intake up again
    - much better if we could just gravity feed pellets and only refeed every 10 minutes rather than racing to refeed every 1-2 minutes
- cleaning the pizza stone and minimizing flour is essential
    - the current approach of metal brush doesn't work as the metal brush is eaten by the heat! - it also is not that effective at removing burned stuff
    - need an alternative sweep
    - this seems better: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MKMJ7FY
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/uuni/comments/kjqfqm/best_brush_to_remove_ash_between_pizzas_for_ooni/
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/uuni/comments/n9y1xw/metal_brush_for_cleaning_stone_between_pizzas/
- need to move the fire to the front + get enough pellets in very quickly before firing pizzas to keep heat consistent
    - gravity fed pellets should be used rather than keeping fire burning with only a few at a time, even though that gave us nice hot temps
    - need to use the thermometer
- need to actually use thermometer more often and understand what the ideal temp should look like both in the center of the stone and in the back
- need to optimize the pipeline itself
    - people again had too many jobs
    - dough stretching must be done according to technique without roller pin which squishes out air and makes the dough denser and longer to cook
    - no one should have to hold the chimney baffle in place
    - we should actually make personal pizzas - 10 inch pizzas (not 12), adjust recipe, we will need a lot less flour and we can pack things in the proofing tray easier
- proofing tray should be used instead of tupperware for sure - its too much work to clean tupperware
- we should prep all vegetables and cheese and sauce ahead of time in the slice kitchen, only doing stuff in the cory courtyard if needed lazily
    - we need to use a lot less ingredients here, less is more
    - we bought too many tomatoes, bell peppers, and onions
    - we need a bit more variety + slice basil ahead of time
    - prepping garlic is very time consuming without the right equipment - using pre-sliced garlic might be worth it here
- we should not use cornmeal, only flour
- we should only have 2 pizza variants and just force people to choose one
    - greatly minimize the number of unique toppings
- switch to 10" personal pizzas + ask Ooni for dough recipe modification
- get more disposable stuff from Costco (plates, bowls)

## Dealing with Ooni Chimney Baffle

> Order: US963992
> Serial: P0AD00-30-MNZ5Q
>
> Hi,
>
> I'm having a great time with my Fyra 12! But there is one major issue. The chimney baffle isn't staying in the open position - the control seems very loose and trying to tighten the nut doesn't help. As a result, the baffle often gets closed during operation (without us manipulating the baffle control) and the fire gets stuffed and smoke builds in the oven (and the hopper is also covered with sticky soot that I can't clean). I've had to resort to having someone with fireproof gloves managing the baffle carefully during oven operation. I'm using the Ooni wood pellets and firestarter and carefully managing the fire as far I can tell. I'm also using a small fan to push air into the oven from the back to make sure there is sufficient oxygen for the fire.
>
> Secondly, I noticed a small chip on the pizza stone (pictures attached). I'm not sure if it was damaged during shipping since I don't think I've moved the pizza stone since I received it.
>
> Could you ship me a replacement chimney (with baffle) and hopper? It would be nice to get a replacement pizza stone too, but I understand if you believe it was not damaged during shipping.
>
> Thanks so much for your help!
>
> Thanks,
> Vighnesh

### Retrospective

Overall, a lot better than last time.
We were able to turn out 26 (11") + 2 (8") pizzas in around 1.5 hours.
The crust quality was excellent - flaky and airy and the right amount of sourness.
The toppings and sauce were also excellent.
The only negatives would be the crust evenness, some excess burning due to too high oven temperature, and too much chewiness due to slight excess thickness.

Now for the things that we still need to improve and fix:

- Salty pizza with parm, sauce, and crust
    - Adding parm to an already salty pizza sauce creates too much salt
    - Next time, reduce the sauce salt to only 1/2 tsp per 28oz can of tomatoes
- White smoke issue still persists
    - Poking is essential to ensure clean burn! I didn't know this until near the end and finally got better results this way
    - I need to do some investigation as to what white smoke means past moisture issues
- Fewer toppings are required, esp meats
    - We bought too many meat toppings, but the amount of cheese and sauce was nearly perfect (next time only need 3 cans of tomatoes, 4 is excessive)
- Streaming pizza is more reasonable than personal pizzas when we have more then 5-ish people
    - We switched to streaming right away as we recognized that there were too many people to feed individually
- Crack open poison early to get more drinking going, pour glasses preemptively
- Need a dough scraper to fetch dough from proofing boxes
    - I forgot my dough cutter at home, but things went ok anyways. But really we should get a nice dough knife
- We packed the proofing boxes too tightly
    - I packed the proofing boxes with 3x4 230g doughballs - they expanded a bit too much and were a bit hard to separate
- Can use a little less yeast (3g/1kg) when doing 3 rising stages (initial large doughball proof, cold proof, room temp warmup + final proof)
    - Next time, we might want to elide the cold proof and instead make the dough the morning of the event
    - This should make it easy to do room temp proofing and give us a more consistent rise

## Spring Break 2024 Pizza Night

### Recipes

#### Tomato Sauce

- Ingredients: 3 14oz cans DOP whole San Marzano tomatoes, salt, dried oregano, sugar, olive oil
    - This is sufficient for 3x8 12" pizzas (one tomato can is about 8-12 pizzas)
- Separate the whole tomatoes from the puree in the can, place the whole tomatoes into a deep container. Keep the puree in another container in case the sauce becomes too thick.
- Use an immersion blender to blend the tomatoes relatively smooth (but not completely smooth)
- Finish with 3 tablespoons olive oil, 3 teaspoons dried oregano, 0-1 teaspoons salt (taste and adjust, keep salt low, parm will add more salt), 0-3 teaspoons sugar (taste and adjust, might not be necessary)

#### Dough

- We will be making standard 12" (250g) doughballs
- [Ooni Classic Pizza Dough](https://ooni.com/blogs/recipes/classic-pizza-dough)
- Makes 4 250g 12" pizza doughballs
    - 368g lukewarm water
    - 3 ½ grams active dry yeast, or 2.7 grams instant dried yeast, or 8 ½ grams fresh yeast
      - Use a little less active dry yeast (maybe 2.5-3g, last time the proof was too aggressive)
    - 613 grams “00” flour, plus extra for dusting
    - 18 grams sea salt
- Recipe
    - Add water and yeast to large bowl and whisk
    - Add salt and flour to other bowl and pour into wet bowl
    - Stir with wooden spoon the mix by hand, then knead for 10 minutes on floured work surface
    - Return dough to bowl, cover with wet dishtowel, and let rise for 10 minutes in warm area
    - Divide into doughballs, place in proofing tray, and allow to rise another 20-30 minutes, then place in fridge
    - The next day, proof again at room temp for 2-3 hours or until doubled in size
- We need to make 4/5 batches of this recipe
- Assuming 16 pizzas, we need 3.6kg flour

#### Pizzas

- We will be making 2 types of pizzas, alternating
- Margherita
    - tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, grated parm, basil, crushed garlic, olive oil
- Pepperoni and prosciutto
    - tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, grated parm, olive oil, prosciutto, salami
- We will provision for 20 12" pizzas

### Retrospective

Overall things went pretty well!
We were mostly bound by the rate of pizza consumption rather than production!
We turned out 14-ish 12" pizzas and the quality kept improving throughout the night.
The tomato sauce was absolutely perfect and flavorful.
Dough quality was also excellent, and was quite stretchable.
But as usual, there were some issues we need to address:

- Equipment overprovisioning
  - In general, I still brought too much stuff from home. Dishcloths, baking gloves, lots of spoons, scissors, trash bag, tongs, tupperware (all unnecessary and unused)
  - However, there is one piece of equipment I actually need - a nice metal poker (but for now, I can keep using my spatula)
  - If I were to buy all equipment such that nothing needs to brought from home, **I would need**: dough slicer/knife, metal poker, microplane, some ladles and spoons
- Excess yeasty flavor of the dough
  - This time I used 3g of yeast (vs 3.5g) for every batch of dough, but that was still too much I feel - the dough puffed up a lot and had a strong yeasty flavor
  - I did an overnight cold proof (total ~15 hours) after a 2 hour warm proof + doughball splitting
- Garlic was overpowering
  - The garlic mash didn't have much of a garlic flavor on the pizza, but rather just added a stinging feeling in the tongue which detracted from the pure tomato/mozzarella/crust flavor. This is expected, it is uncooked raw garlic mash.
  - I would propose that next time we omit the garlic to produce a pure Neapolitan product
- Tomato sauce
  - Add fresh basil leaves to the sauce, leave out oregano and add on top later to see the difference
- Pizza prep
  - It seems we need a **larger region for crust** on the pizza (1.5" offset from edge), also the crust must be **thicker** than the rest of the pizza for better puffing
  - Move sauce inwards, and use 1.5 scoops of sauce (don't overdo it)
  - I need to buy **Caputo semolina flour** for dusting and stretching the dough, I shouldn't use 00 flour for this (of course don't use cornmeal lol)
  - Flour underneath the dough **needs to be swept away** before pulling the dough onto the wood peel (excess underneath flour leads to burning)
- Ingredient quality
  - What I thought was high quality: DOP tomatoes, 00 flour + yeast, DOP parm, basil, olive oil, meats (sufficiently enough, I guess)
  - What needs better quality: mozzarella (the top burned too easily, a bit too chewy, not sufficiently creamy - it detracted from the texture of the crust)
    - The best would be DOP mozzarella di bufala campana, but this is probably too expensive and hard to find
    - We should shoot for finding some real buffalo mozzarella, but domestic should be OK
    - [Belfiore Cheese](https://belfiorecheese.com/all-products/) in West Berkeley is pretty accessible and produces high quality mozzarella. They even have [Fior Di Latte](https://belfiorecheese.com/portfolio/fior-di-latte-organic/)!
      - They don't sell from their manufacturing place, but they claim to distribute to **Safeway** and **Berkeley Bowl**
    - I can also look in **Cheeseboard**, but it will be expensive, **Costco** might carry fior di latte
    - The ideal amount is 80-100g of mozzarella per 12" pizza
  - [The Perfect Way to Put Cheese on Neapolitan Pizza⏐Before & After](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-O9LUDtH_g)
    - Classic problem with buffalo mozzarella - watery blob around the cheese after cooking. The video proposes this fix:
    - Cut the mozz into thinner pieces (but still semi-circular) and **place it in a draining tray overnight** to make sure the milk is drained away
- White smoke
  - Sooty pizza flavor on the stone, excess soot production that goes along with white smoke
  - [Reddit post on the same thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/uuni/comments/g9m73k/advice_for_ooni3_regarding_pellets_brand_and/)
    1. Make sure the pellets are dried under 10% moisture - I should stick my current pellets in the oven in sheet trays and weigh them before and after
    2. White smoke can come from pellets getting hot, but not actually being on fire. This comes from the fire being right under the hopper opening rather than in the front of the firebox! I am so dumb. We started with the fire mostly in the front and because I was impatient, I thought I should light another firestarter in the back! What a foolish mistake - next time, just be patient, and create a front-biased fire and load pellets slowly but consistently.
- A new dough recipe specialized for bulk cold proof (now that we have 2x experience with the classic recipe)
  - Pizzapp+ gives nice measurements according to desired proof times
  - 100% poolish dough (see Vito Iacopelli's videos) - this seems like an elite technique, must try
