# Power Tool

## Grand Vision

We want to build an open-source, clean, from scratch PowerPro.
To do this, we need a synthesis tool.
To make a synthesis tool in a novel way, we would want to leverage egraphs somehow.
To leverage egraphs effectively and aggressively cache/dedup circuit elements

We also need a RTL simulation tool.
