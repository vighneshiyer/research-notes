# Independent Research Institutions

- So there has been a lot of talk about grad student strikes and so forth, and one of the big problems is that there is no real leverage students have with a university.
- In particular, in comparch research, there is absolutely no incentive to 'strike' and at the same time the university puts up a lot of hinderance to making logistical advancements (hiring good faculty, dealing with financial nonsense, "tuition" fakery, and so forth)
- Is it possible to create a 'from scratch' research institution that takes students with a BS and "graduates" them without the conferrence of an actual degree - basically a shop that allows people to live and work in a shared space, get paid a nominal stipend, and do real research as early grad students, with no expectation of a piece of paper, but rather just research experience and publications?
- What is it that the university actually adds to any research lab:
    - A educational institute and all of its benefits (e.g. free stuff) - this isn't a big deal - anyone can get educational status for their independent research org
    - Financing help - the university is actually a hinderance here, if professors could directly get financing from industry sponsors and grants as usual, then there would be plenty of money inflows, esp considering what students want is a learning environment and research systems
    - A university campus - this is unnecessary of course but nice to have - what is more critical is a shared workspace
    - What are the attractors? get paid a stipend, have academic freedom to pursue whatever you want, surrounded by peers with similar goals, unified under a professor who can provide unified direction over the lab
    - Olin college is arguably an attempt at this, but trying to capture capital intensive areas like biology and biomedical engineering is not going to fly at the onset and will just result in 'tuitions' rather than stipends. You are paying students for research throughput after all.
        - Focus on a specific subfield and have a lab led by a single leader is the ideal position
        - Recruitment is the toughest thing, but I could bootstrap this with my own capital
    - The nice thing is that just one rich patron could easily finance this. Grad students cost very little if the rent is taken care of - actually just $2k/month is quite a lot if housing and food are taken care of (which is easy in the place I envision). So a team of 10 "grad students" only costs $240k / year (double that if you want some staff and compute equipment and dealing with housing/food) and that can actually be financed by just one person.
        - There can even be income if corporate sponsorships of $100k/year can be achieved (with internship offers and recruiting pipeline)
        - Useless expenses like "university tuition" can be elided completely
        - Patronage by the other people living in the community is doable
    - The biggest issue seems to be issuance of a PhD or MS degree without going through the "accredication" gauntlet and racket. But if people are willing to forgo this in lieu of publications and open source artifacts - isn't that more than good enough?
- One potential source of income is selling support for an in-house designed curriculum
    - This could encompass everything in the area of computer architecture (designed using cross-cutting-abstraction, increasing-depth teaching methodology)
    - The curriculum could even be sponsored by universities and hosted externally in a way to support university extension classes
    - Also consider Bora's advice on reading fundamental papers in all related fields of natural sciences and working up to more detailed fundamental papers in EECS in particular, and then arch specifically
    - Designing such a curriculum would be very interesting work indeed and probably is a way to earn reputation and minor income (if tutoring / credentialing / certification became a thing)
        - Yeah, actually just teaching 'classes' and marketing that to early stage people in industry would be very helpful
        - After all, if there is demand for 'Chipyard classes', then there must be demand for more fundamental and useful and broadly applicable things too?
    - We have open source CAD tools and PDKs now too - they aren't that great, but it allows us to mitigate commercial tool issues entirely for time being

## A Private CompArch Research Institute

- one unified leader pursuing a concrete agenda (project-driven)
- ownership of land for workspaces and living and cooking (no rent overhead, no staff)
- borrow 'curriculum' from other schools - focus on private tutoring and intensive learning through doing, rather than lecture/discussion/lab nonsense

- on 2/18/2024, joonho discussed 'bee theory'
    - there is a fraction of bees in a colony that are freeriders on the work of the rest of the colony
    - if those hardworking bees are isolated and transplanted in a new fresh colony, we find that a fraction of those bees *become* freeriders
    - so there seems to be a fundamental societal limitation that could compromise any independent institution the same way it compromises a company
- what if we also controlled our living environment next to the lab environment? all kinds of expenses could be drastically eliminated, the cost of doing research would plummet as long as the people themselves aren't money-driven (which seems reasonable on the face of it, but will be a heavy recruiting challenge, it seems like only those without kids and usually single men would be amenable to this arrangement anyways)
- this on the whole is a reasonable idea but only for those who already know how to do research
- funding can be via government or private grants - darpa, DoE, and industry sponsors
    - look into people who currently receive darpa grants, e.g. andreas (at ZeroASIC) but operate seemingly for-profit companies
    - funding can also be self-sustained (e.g. do contract work for 3-6 months of the year, feed into the institition, and then research for the remainder of the time)
