# Performance Correlation

## 5/2/2023

- embench on rv64, current status - able to get it to compile for rv64 using baremetal and run on gem5 and that works!
    - we also have perf statistics from gem5
- Next: embench rv64 on Rocket, which implies we first need embench rv64 on spike
    - Currently, embench on spike: works with `pk`
    - md5sum (on gem5 perf stats): 2.3M insts, 0.86 CPI (???, odd, Rocket can only commit 1 inst per cycle)
- Next: we need a way to collect perf statistics out of rocket (out-of-band) in RTL simulation
    - Ideally we want this to work on Firesim too
    - Chisel printf (https://www.chisel-lang.org/chisel3/docs/explanations/printing.html)
    - Chipyard (https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Chipyard-Basics/Initial-Repo-Setup.html, https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Simulation/Software-RTL-Simulation.html)
    - Nayiri I think has a perf statistic dumper already somewhere? Using for arch counter based power modeling
        - Just ask her for the branch and diff
    - Build an RTL simulation and validate that we can dump accurate statistics by correlating it with manually observed values from the waveform
    - Next: make sure collecting stats of programs running on pk works just fine, and tune the N-cycles that a statistic is aggregated over
    - Next: make sure the ISA tests correlate first between RTL simulation and gem5 (we need to make sure the arch params that gem5 is configured with are accurate and representative)
    - Next: move on to the embench stuff
- Later: build a generic perf counter framework that can collect OOB stats and correlate with a commit log
- TODO: get Dhruv access to Millennium machines with LDAP creds

- Refer to the gem5 paper below
- Also look at a riscv gem5 evaluation: https://carrv.github.io/2021/papers/CARRV2021_paper_63_Chatzopoulos.pdf
- Also take a look at the gem5 model configuration for a real SiFive board: https://gem5.googlesource.com/public/gem5/+/refs/heads/stable/src/python/gem5/prebuilt/riscvmatched/riscvmatched_core.py#85
- Strober paper: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3007787.3001151
- SimPoint stuff: https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~calder/simpoint/
- Try to play with gem5 riscv - build a simple in-order core model (that looks like your 151 CPU) and run a riscv binary through it

## 2/7/2023

- Hansung (maybe GPU RTL), Abe (Chipyard various things)
- Baseline understanding of tools
    - Chisel (https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-bootcamp (Ch. 1-3), https://github.com/ucb-bar/chisel-tutorial)
    - Chipyard (building RTL, building an RTL simulator - Verilator / VCS, ran a RISC-V binary through it, insn retirement log)
        - https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard
        - https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ (look through Ch 1 and 2) - be able to build a Verilator RTL simulator of the default Chipyard SoC config and run some riscv ISA tests through the RTL simulator
    - ISS (inside Chipyard, there is a ISA simulator called spike - spike can also run RISC-V binaries, it will also give you an insn retirement log)
        - https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim

- TODOs:
    - Build spike from source (in Chipyard)
    - Run spike on RISC-V binaries (chipyard/toolchains/riscv-tools/riscv-tests)
    - Check the cmdline arguments of spike and get a insn retirement log out
    - Check this against the log from RTL simulation

- Read through this guide, and try compiling gem5 and running x86 binaries through it, and get out a performance trace: https://www.gem5.org/documentation/learning_gem5/introduction/
- Investigate how to get the RISC-V port of gem5 working, and run RISC-V binaries through it with a baseline CPU uArch model (we can just model a simple in-order 5 stage pipeline with the typical bypass paths you're used to)

- Relevant papers:
    - Architectural Simulators Considered Harmful (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7155440) - a critique of arch sim, and their accuracy, and why it is better to evaluate RTL, and if you were to build an arch sim - why you should have knowledge of RTL design to begin with
