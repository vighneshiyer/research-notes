# Semantic Protocol Compression for NoCs

## Overview

- If we have a schema of transactions, and many traces of real traffic, can we find an optimal encoding/decoding scheme to minimize bus/NoC traffic?
    - e.g. in TL, we have several message types: Get(addr), Put(addr, data), ...
    - Can we design hardware to go from these messages to raw packet bits that can later be decoded?
    - Can we also design a more optimal physical encoding rather than just putting each transaction field on a seperate wire? Can the hardware then operate on this more efficient encoding directly?
    - We will have to trade-off the PPA complexity of the decoder/encoder and the savings we get in bandwidth and network traffic
    - We can't use an online compression scheme since it will take too much area; also we know what type of traffic to expect, so we can use offline profiling and the design of a custom compression network-wide scheme for a given transaction schema
    - e.g. we can use delta compression for addresses and/or we can use entropy encoding for opcodes, and/or magic constants for common values such as all ones or all zeros, or turning one-hot signals into multi-bit signals (e.g. byte-wise mask into an uinteger), we can elide fields that are unused in certain message types. We can have different codecs for master->slave traffic vs slave->master traffic. Encodings may be stateful and reuse addresses/offsets of previous transactions.
    - This type of context-aware (protocol/transaction schema aware) technique should work better than raw packet compression techniques simply because we can take advantage of the user-defined semantics of the protocol

    - We want to compare on aggregate PPA cost and benefit and on real RTL evaluation unlike their simulator based eval

- Generating Compact Physical Encodings of Transaction-Level Messages
- Can we discover a memory protocol that is more compressible than TileLink / AXI4+ACE / CHI?
    - Discover a common set of primitives that can express the same logical operations as an existing memory protocol, but is more compressible
    - Major problem: how can we prove equivalance and discover rewrite rules to unify 2 sets of primitives
    - Automatic generation of protocol adapters via program synthesis and rewriting
        - Can we automatically synthesize a TL to CXL protocol adapter?
        - Can we formally make sure a protocol never deadlocks and holes in a mapping.

```scala
Get(addr, nBytes)

Read(addr, `nBytes < 8`, beats: Int)

def translate(g: Get): Seq[Read] = {
    ???
}
```

## Tasks

### Naive Compression Eval

- [ ] Build a Rocket + Constellation (single-node) NoC
    - Simple connection from Rocket to L2 (4 banks) via a small NoC network
- [ ] Validate simple riscv benchmarks can run in RTL sim
- [ ] Add prints for the raw packet traffic going through each NoC node
- [ ] Collect prints from multiple ubenchmarks
- [ ] Parse prints into raw packets sent on each node
- [ ] Run a set of naive compression algorithms directly on the entire packet / the tail flits
    - This is the theoretical peak - it is isn't feasible since the NoC would have to decompress the routing info on each hop to route the packet
    - Only compressing the tail flits is more reasonable since the decompression only happens once the packet reaches its target node (but extra buffering is necessary)

### Protocol Aware Compression

- [ ] Add prints on each TL ingress/egress node to print the entire TL packet data (per channel)
- [ ] Do some manual evaluation of TL transactions on each node (does this look compressible?)
